Place your 1024x1024 PNG icon here as app_icon.png (ideally no transparency for Android).
Suggested: a simple calendar-style icon matching the in-app calendar symbol.
After adding the file, run:
  dart run flutter_launcher_icons
Generated icons will be placed into Android/iOS projects automatically.
